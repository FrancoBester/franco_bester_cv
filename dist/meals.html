        <p>Our in-house Food Service Department will take care of all of your dietary needs during your stay.</p>
        <p>You will receive 3 meals daily.</p>
        <p>Each morning, you will receive a menu from which to select your meals for the next day.</p>
        <p>Should you not be available when the order is taken, you will receive the Chef's Choice for the day.</p>
        <p>If you would like to request a special meal, such as kosher or halal, please indicate so during your admission to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Certain conditions or treatments may require that your doctor prescribes certain dietary items for you.</p>
        <p>This is normal and part of a treatment plan for your specific condition or recovery.</p>
        <p>In such cases, your doctor will indicate to us when you are allowed to order "normal" dietary items from the menu.</p>
        <p>Day case theatre patients will be served a light meal post-operatively.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to request a second helping.</p>
