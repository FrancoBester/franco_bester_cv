        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Cormed Clinic officially opened its doors in October 1992 as a 20 bed day clinic. The initiative was led by the late Dr. Corrie Lategan in collaboration with several shareholders.</p>
        <p>As Cormed became a hospital of choice for patients, physicians, and specialists, the healthcare needs of the community increased, and several expansions were inevitable.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        <p>Cormed Clinic now offers medical and surgical wards, a ICU and High Care unit, a Maternity ward, and Casualty department.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        <p>Our hospital has consistently provided exceptional care and service that families have relied on for generations, even in the face of challenges and changes.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        <p>The success of our hospital is due to our dedicated, passionate, and committed employees, shareholders, and physicians.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">"The heart of Cormed Private Hospital lies within its people." - Dr. P.J. Lategan.</p>
